## Reconstructed Evolution of Insulin Receptors in Insects Reveals Duplications in Early Insects and Cockroaches - Supplementary Files

This repository contains supplementary data and scripts to the publication mentioned in the title.

**[Data](data/):**

* [Table_S1_genomes.pdf](data/Table_S1_genomes.pdf)
Table S1: Source websites and version numbers of the 22 arthropod genomes and genome annotations that were searched for insulin
receptor genes

* [protein-alignment_arthropod-InRs_MAFFT.fa](data/protein-alignment_arthropod-InRs_MAFFT.fa)  
The protein alignment of all 46 insulin receptors, provided in fasta format. Computed with MAFFT.

* [protein-tree_arthropod-InRs_RAxML-JTT+I+G+F.nwk](data/protein-tree_arthropod-InRs_RAxML-JTT+I+G+F.nwk)  
The protein tree depicted in [Figure 2](figures/Figure_2.pdf) in Newick format. Computed with RAxML with the JTT+I+G+F model based on the protein alignment above.

* [arthropod-InR_gene-IDs.txt](data/arthropod-InR_gene-IDs.txt)  
A mapping of our InR nomenclature to the corresponding gene IDs (e.g. "Bger_InR1" corresponds to the gene "Bger_13643").
